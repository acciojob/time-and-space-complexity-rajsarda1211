    <h1>Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>
    <p>Time complexity refers to the computational time an algorithm takes to complete. It helps in determining how efficient an algorithm is, especially as the input size grows.</p>
    <p><b>Space Complexity</b> is the amount of memory an algorithm uses as it runs. For instance, an algorithm with space complexity of O(n) requires memory proportional to the input size.</p>
